# Wine Quality Prediction with Different Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains code and data for predicting wine quality using various machine learning algorithms. In this project, we explore three different algorithms:

1. **Ridge Regression**
2. **Lasso Regression**
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
4. **Decision Trees**

## Dataset- [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset)
