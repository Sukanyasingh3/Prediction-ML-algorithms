## Introduction

Wine quality prediction is a classic problem in machine learning where the objective is to predict the quality of wine based on various chemical and physical properties. This project focuses on implementing and evaluating the performance of different machine learning algorithms for this task.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Wine Quality Dataset, which contains information about various attributes of wines along with their corresponding quality ratings. The dataset is included in the repository (`wine_quality.csv`), and it is sourced from [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset).

## Algorithms

The following machine learning algorithms are implemented and compared in this project:

1. **Ridge Regression**: A linear regression technique that incorporates regularization to prevent overfitting.

2. **Lasso Regression**: Similar to Ridge Regression but uses L1 regularization, which can lead to sparse coefficient values.

3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: A supervised learning algorithm for classification and regression tasks, effective in high-dimensional spaces.

4. **Decision Trees**: A non-linear model that makes decisions based on the values of features, forming a tree-like structure.
